# Weekly Builds
I'm trying to build or experiment with something new every weekend for a year, I'm using this as a quick-dump of each thing I play with. It's not a gimmick, it's just to give me a framework for learning new things. I anticipate very few people will ever see this!

Too often I start a project with some grand idea of the end goal or blog post. This is an attempt to leverage the "little and often" approach to learning.

## How it works

Every weekend I will:

1. Build or experiment with something new. Doesn't matter how small. [Recommendations welcome](http://twitter.com/peterejhamilton).
2. Write it up in a README, however rough/brief and commit the results to this repo.

Pretty simple, let's see what happens.
